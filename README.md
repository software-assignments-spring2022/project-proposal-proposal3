# GoCoffee 
A universal coffee ordering app for mobile devices - order any coffee you like at any coffee shop near you and pick it up in no time. 
# What and Why 
This application allows users to order any cup of coffee from any local coffee shop - allowing them to skip queues and get their 
coffee at the time they want. Many large coffee chains already employ a coffee ordering system (Starbucks, Costa, etc), which gives them an 
advantage over smaller / more independant coffee shops. This application acts a hub for all coffee shops - big and small - and gives the smaller 
shops a leg up, evening the playing field for them. 
# For Who 
Any coffee lover / general public. 
# How 
On the application, users will be given options to see what coffee shops are near them on a map, an ability to order a certain coffee for a given time, gain rewards, and leave reviews on the coffee shops they have gone to. 
# Scope 
The project would mainly be focussed on front-end user experiences that would be easy to implement - however a database of 
the coffee shops for an area and relaying orders to the appropriate shops may be difficult. It is hard to tell the difficulty of implementing 
such a project due to the various features and their requirements, but a basic implementation does not seem to be out of the realm of the workload 
for a group of 4-6 people.
